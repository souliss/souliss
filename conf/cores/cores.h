#ifndef CORES_H
#define CORES_H

// Actually there is a tight dependency with core releases especially for
// products that gets frequent updates, in some cases we can use the below
// option to runs on special cores.

// By default there is always a single core release supported for each 
// microcontroller class, but some exception can help to handle the time between
// a core release and the relevant distribution of the updates.
