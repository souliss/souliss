    Souliss - Zero Configuration
    
    This example demonstrate a zero configuration setup, with the following
    network architecture:
    
    HOME-ROUTER                     GATEWAY (n1)    
    ETHERNET        (connect)       ETHERNET    
    
    HOME-ROUTER                     BRIDGE  (n2)    
    ETHERNET        (connect)       ETHERNET    
    
    BRIDGE (n2)                     PEER (n3)
    RS-485 A        (connect)       RS-485 A
    RS-485 B        (connect)       RS-485 B
    RS-485 GND      (optional)      RS-485 GND

    The Gateway gets an IP address via DHCP, the Bridge works in IPBROADCAST
    and doesn't request an IP address but only a vNet address (through the Gateway)
    as last the Peer get the subnet from the Bridge and the vNet address from the
    Gateway.
    
    As startup procedure, 
    1) Turn on the Gateway and waits until SoulissApp detect it
    2) Turn on the Bridge and waits until the LED get solid on
    3) Turn on the Peer and waits until the LED get solid on
    
    At this time the network is up and you can run it.
