/**************************************************************************
    Souliss - Curtains
    
    It control a curtain with two devices: one device act on the relays
    that drive the motor and get the limit switches, the other has one 
    hardwired pushbutton for opening and closing the door. The curtain can 
    be controller via Android (or any equivalent direct user interface) 
    connecting to bridge node.
    
    Ensure to use limit switches to protect the motor once the door is completely
    closed or open, if limit switches are not used the motor should be self-protected.

    Run this code on one of the following boards:
      - Chibiduino v1
      
    As option you can run the same code on the following, just changing the
    relevant configuration file at begin of the sketch
      - Moteino
