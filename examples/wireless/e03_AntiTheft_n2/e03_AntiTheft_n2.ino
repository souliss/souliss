    Souliss - Anti-theft Integration (Main Node)

    The anti-theft integration allow the handling of sensors distributed in the
    home, reporting if an alarm is raised to a standard anti-theft system.
    Two communication paths are build for the case, one care of data exchanging
    between the nodes involved in the anti-theft and the other is used to provide
    a distributed watch-dog. A fail of one node will result in a fail of the 
    watch-dog and and so rising an alarm to the anti-theft.
    
    A standard anti-theft system can be integrated via its auxiliary inputs or
    equivalent.
    
    Run this code on one of the following boards:
      - Chibiduino v1
      
    As option you can run the same code on the following, just changing the
    relevant configuration file at begin of the sketch
      - Moteino
