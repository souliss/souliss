 * halfprecision converts the input argument to/from a half precision floating
 * point bit pattern corresponding to IEEE 754r. The bit pattern is stored in a
 * uint16 class variable. Please note that halfprecision is *not* a class. That
 * is, you cannot do any arithmetic with the half precision bit patterns.
 * halfprecision is simply a function that converts the IEEE 754r half precision
 * bit pattern to/from other numeric MATLAB variables. You can, however, take
 * the half precision bit patterns, convert them to single or double, do the
 * operation, and then convert the result back manually.
 *
 * Note that the special cases of -Inf, +Inf, and NaN are handled correctly.
 * Also, note that the -1e30 and 1e30 values overflow the half precision format
 * and are converted into half precision -Inf and +Inf values, and stay that
 * way when they are converted back into doubles.
 *
 * For the denormalized cases, note that 2^(-24) is the smallest number that can
 * be represented in half precision exactly. 2^(-25) will convert to 2^(-24)
 * because of the rounding algorithm used, and 2^(-26) is too small and underflows
 * to zero.
